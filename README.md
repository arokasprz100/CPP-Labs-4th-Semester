# C++ Laboratories (4th Semester)

This repository contains my solutions for Object Oriented Programming exercises. During this course, we use C++ to solve some small programming problems. This course took place during 4th semester of Applied Computer Science (AGH University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science).

## Some rules
During laboratory classes, we are not allowed to use any form of documentation (not even our own notes or c++ reference). At the begining of each laboratory, we receive some files (most of the time one, but sometimes it's more), that we cannot change. We are not allowed to change anything in main() function. Our task is to write some other .h and .cpp files to make the program compile and produce expected output. Laboratories last 90 minutes. If our program does not compile, we do not receive any points. 

## Points
During each laboratory classes, we can receive 10 points:
 - 1 point for documentation we write to our code
 - 2 points for compilation (no warnings etc.)
 - 3 points for output and memory management (if output does not match the one given in main file or there is a memory leak, we receive no points at all for this part)
 - 4 points for code quality 
 
Lab descriptions are mainly in polish. Solutions are in polish or in english, depending on language code in main function had been prepared in. Laboratories in pairs were written with Paweł Kępka and Dawid Kobak.
 
Please note that my solution should not be used as a form of cheating during your classes.
